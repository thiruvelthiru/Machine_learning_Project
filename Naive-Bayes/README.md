**Naive-Bayes-Algorithm**

**Introduction**


Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes' Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset. Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.


**Bayes' Theorem**


Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on conditional probability. The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:

**How to use Bayes Theorem**


Here we have a dataset of weather conditions and a corresponding target variable 'Play'. Now we have to predict they will play or not when the weather is Sunny. So to solve this problem, we need to follow the below steps:


1) Convert the given dataset into frequency tables


2) Generate a Likelihood table by finding the probabilities of given features


3) Now, use the Bayes theorem to calculate the posterior probability
